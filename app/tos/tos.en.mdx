_Last updated: September 11, 2025_  

fxRate Web is an open-source project released under the MIT License. These Terms apply **only to the demo service provided by the author** and do not apply to any third-party self-hosted instances.

By accessing or using fxRate Web (the "Website"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service. **If you do not agree, you must stop using the Website immediately.**

If there is any inconsistency or ambiguity between the English version and the Chinese version, the Chinese version shall prevail.

### 1. Service Content and Data Disclaimer

This Website aggregates and displays exchange rates (CNY against various foreign currencies) as published by certain banks within mainland China. The service is for reference only. It is **not** a platform for currency exchange, payments, account opening, or any other licensed financial service.  

- All rates shown are collected from banks' official websites or other publicly available sources.  
- Due to caching, rate limits, network issues, changes in data formats, or other technical reasons, the displayed data may suffer from **delays, gaps, errors, or inconsistencies** compared to the banks' official data.  
- Always rely on the data published directly by banks' official websites or apps. We make **no guarantees** regarding timeliness, accuracy, completeness, availability, or suitability of the displayed data.  

### 2. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

The content of this Website is for **general informational purposes only**. Nothing here constitutes investment advice, a trading recommendation, or a financial service offering. You should independently verify all data and, when necessary, consult professional advisors or financial institutions.  

**Any direct or indirect losses arising from your use of or reliance on this Website, including but not limited to lost profits, business interruption, data loss, opportunity costs, or replacement costs, is your sole responsibility.**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree that:  

- You waive any claims or demands against the Website operator, its affiliates, or partners (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") relating to your use of or reliance on this Website.  
- The Indemnified Parties are not liable for any damages (including indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages), even if they have been advised of the possibility of such damages.  
- In any event, the operator's total liability shall not exceed the total amount you paid to the operator in the three (3) months prior to the event giving rise to the claim (if nothing was paid, then zero CNY).  

### 3. User Obligations, Prohibited Conduct, and Service Termination

By using this Website, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and these Terms. You must not:  

- Disrupt, interfere with, or attempt unauthorized access to the Website or its systems;

- Use the Website for illegal, infringing, fraudulent, or harmful purposes;  
- Remove or alter any notices, trademarks, or source information;  
- Use the Website's data directly for automated trading, programmatic order placement, or risk management in high-stakes scenarios (unless you validate the data independently and assume all associated risks).  

Violation of these rules may result in measures including but not limited to **rate limiting, access blocking, or legal action**.  

### 4. License and Intellectual Property

Subject to these Terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use the Website for **personal, non-commercial purposes only**.  

Bank names, trademarks, and logos remain the property of their respective owners. We only aggregate publicly available data and do not claim any rights over them.

- We do not sell your personal information or use it for marketing purposes.  
- Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you share are considered non-confidential and royalty-free. By submitting them, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, sublicensable license to use them for any purpose.  

### 6. Service Modification, Disclaimer, and Dispute Resolution

- We are not responsible for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control, such as natural disasters, wars, strikes, policy changes, power outages, or infrastructure failures. We will make reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact.  
- We may modify, upgrade, suspend, or terminate the Website or parts of it at any time, without prior notice.  
- If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid in a jurisdiction, it will be adjusted to the minimum extent necessary to reflect its intent, without affecting the validity of other provisions. Section titles are for convenience only.  
- These Terms are governed by the laws of Mainland China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan regions).  
- Any disputes shall first be resolved through good-faith negotiations. If negotiations fail, either party may bring the case to the people's court in the operator's place of domicile. You waive the right to challenge the jurisdiction of that court.  
- You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from any third-party claims, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your misuse of the Website, violation of these Terms, infringement of others' rights, or breaches of law.  
- We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Website means you accept the updated version. For major changes, we may provide a notice but are not legally required to do so.  

### 7. Protection of Minors

You represent and warrant that:  

- You are at least 18 years old, or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction;
